# EasierVRAssets

Hello there! This repository contains a collection of packages that are intended to help developers working with Virtual Reality apps specifically for the __Oculus Quest__ on __Unity__ with improving the development pipeline. These packages are intended to be drag-and-drop, working in a scene with only slight modifications made to their public variables prior to building a scene.

In order to allow these packages to work, the __Oculus Implementations__  package is required within your Unity project. It is _highly recommended_ that you install the latest version of of the __Oculus Implementations__ package, but a working version of the package has been provided in case the latest version is facing bugs and/or issues.

Each package in this repo contains a README file that explains the nuances of each package, including how they work and what public variables are most important when integrating these packages and prefabs into your own project.

Happy hunting! - Ryan Kim
